# What is Grainlify?

Grainlify is a **grant execution layer** that turns ecosystem funding into **automated, verifiable, non‑custodial payouts** for open‑source contributions.

It sits between **ecosystems**, **projects**, and **contributors**:

- Ecosystems and sponsors lock grant capital into **on‑chain escrows**.
- Project maintainers turn GitHub issues into **funded bounties**.
- Contributors do normal GitHub work (issues and PRs) and get **paid automatically** when their work is merged and verified.

Grainlify does **not** decide who should be funded. Instead, it guarantees **how funding is executed** once programs and projects are set up.
