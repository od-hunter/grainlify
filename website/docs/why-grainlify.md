# Why Grainlify?

Open‑source ecosystems already allocate large **grant budgets**, but today most grant execution looks like:

- funds are managed **off‑chain** in multisigs or internal wallets,
- payouts are decided in spreadsheets and chats,
- contributors wait weeks or months to be paid,
- ecosystems struggle to answer “**what did we actually pay for?**”.

Grainlify exists to fix this.

## Problems with Traditional Grant Execution

- **Manual operations**
  - Every hackathon or grant round requires custom spreadsheets, forms, and payout runs.
- **Subjective or opaque payouts**
  - Contributors rely on maintainers or committees to manually decide who gets paid.
- **Slow contributor experience**
  - Even when work is done, payments are delayed or lost.
- **Limited auditability**
  - Ecosystems cannot easily trace on‑chain transfers back to concrete GitHub work.

## How Grainlify Improves This

Grainlify turns grant execution into a **repeatable, rule‑driven system**:

- **Escrow‑first funding**
  - Ecosystems lock budgets into **on‑chain escrows** before work begins.
  - Contributors can see that funds are real and reserved for the program.

- **GitHub‑native contributions**
  - Work happens entirely on GitHub via issues and PRs.
  - Grainlify syncs this activity and links it to funded bounties.

- **Automated payouts**
  - Once work is merged and verified (and KYC is satisfied), payouts are triggered automatically.
  - Funds move **directly from escrow contracts to contributor wallets**.

- **Verifiable impact**
  - Ecosystems can map grant budgets → programs → projects → specific contributions and payouts.
  - On‑chain history plus off‑chain analytics give a clear impact story.

## Benefits by Persona

- **For ecosystems**
  - Confidence that grant budgets are actually used for real work.
  - Lower operational overhead for each program.
  - Better reporting for communities, boards, and regulators.

- **For maintainers**
  - No need to manage payouts manually.
  - Clear budgets and fewer back‑and‑forths with contributors.
  - Stronger incentives and trust for new contributors.

- **For contributors**
  - Predictable, rule‑based rewards instead of ad‑hoc promises.
  - Non‑custodial, on‑chain payouts to their wallets.
  - A portable contribution history and rewards record.

In short, Grainlify moves ecosystems from **“we funded projects”** to **“we verifiably paid for real work.”**
