By accessing or using Grainlify (the “Service”), you agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.

---

## 2. Description of the Service

Grainlify is a platform that:

- connects open‑source projects, contributors, and funding ecosystems,
- tracks contributions made on GitHub and similar platforms,
- orchestrates non‑custodial, on‑chain payouts from escrow contracts.

Grainlify does **not**:

- hold user funds in custodial wallets,
- guarantee any minimum level of funding or rewards,
- provide legal, tax, or investment advice.

---

## 3. Eligibility

To use the Service, you must:

- be legally capable of entering into binding contracts in your jurisdiction,
- comply with all applicable laws and regulations,
- complete any required **KYC/identity verification** steps if you wish to receive payouts.

Certain jurisdictions or sanctioned persons may be restricted from accessing or using the Service.

## 5. Use of Wallets and On‑Chain Activity

- Payouts are sent **directly** to wallets you provide.
- You are solely responsible for:
  - securing your wallets and private keys,
  - any loss of access to those wallets.
- On‑chain transactions are generally **irreversible**; once executed from escrow, payouts cannot be recalled by the Service.

---

## 6. Funding Programs and Bounties

Ecosystem teams and maintainers may:

- create programs, projects, and bounties,
- lock funds into on‑chain escrows to back those initiatives.

The operator of Grainlify:

- does not guarantee the availability or sufficiency of such funds,
- is not responsible for off‑platform promises made by ecosystems or maintainers.

Program rules (eligibility criteria, deadlines, payout formulas) may be set by ecosystems and/or maintainers and should be clearly communicated in each program or bounty description.

---

## 7. KYC and Compliance

- You may be required to complete KYC with a third‑party provider before receiving payouts.
- By using the Service, you agree that:
  - your KYC status may be used to determine payout eligibility,
  - data related to your identity verification will be handled as described in the **KYC Privacy Notice** and the provider’s own privacy policy.

---

## 8. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

- misuse the Service for illegal activities,
- attempt to circumvent KYC, sanctions, or other compliance controls,
- interfere with or disrupt the Service or related infrastructure,
- impersonate other users or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.

---

## 9. Intellectual Property

Except where otherwise noted:

- the Service’s software, branding, and documentation are owned by the operator or its licensors,
- your use of the Service does not grant ownership rights in that intellectual property.

You retain any rights you have in your own code contributions to projects, subject to the relevant project license.

---

The operator does not warrant that:
