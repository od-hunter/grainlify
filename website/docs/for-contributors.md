# Guide for Contributors

This guide is for **contributors** who want to earn rewards by working on funded open‑source issues through Grainlify.

You will:

- connect your GitHub account,
- complete KYC once,
- link a wallet,
- pick funded issues,
- work via normal GitHub PRs,
- receive automatic payouts when your work is merged and verified.

---

## What You Get as a Contributor

With Grainlify, you can:

- Discover **funded issues** and programs across ecosystems.
- Track your **contribution history** and rewards.
- Receive **automatic, on‑chain payouts** to your wallet when:
  - your work is merged,
  - you are KYC‑verified,
  - program rules are satisfied.

You do not need to manage invoices, off‑platform negotiations, or manual payout coordination.

---

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- A compatible **wallet** (e.g., a Stellar address, depending on the ecosystem).
- Ability to complete **KYC** with the integrated provider (where required).

---

## Step‑by‑Step: From Sign‑Up to Payout

### Step 1 – Log In with GitHub

1. Go to the Grainlify app.
2. Click **“Sign in with GitHub”**.
3. Authorize Grainlify to read your GitHub profile and basic data.

This creates your Grainlify user tied to your GitHub identity.

---

### Step 2 – Complete KYC (If Required)

To receive payouts, you typically must pass **KYC** through the integrated provider (e.g., Didit).

1. Start KYC from your **Profile** or **Payouts** section.
2. You’ll be redirected to the KYC provider’s flow.
3. Follow on‑screen steps to submit required information.
4. Return to Grainlify to see your KYC status:
   - `not_started`
   - `pending`
   - `in_review`
   - `verified`
   - `rejected`
   - `expired`

You can usually continue browsing and working while KYC is pending, but **payouts will only be executed for `verified` contributors**.

---

### Step 3 – Link Your Wallet

1. Open the **Wallets** or **Payouts** section.
2. Add your wallet address (e.g., Stellar address) according to instructions.
3. Optionally set a **default payout wallet**.

This wallet will receive on‑chain payouts directly from escrow contracts once your work is eligible.

---

### Step 4 – Discover Funded Work

Use the **Discover**, **Programs**, or **Projects** tabs to find opportunities:

- Filter by:
  - ecosystem (e.g., Stellar),
  - language or tech stack,
  - project,
  - bounty size or difficulty (if available).
- Look for issues marked as:
  - **funded**, **bounty**, or similar labels,
  - associated with a **program** you’re interested in.

Click into each issue to see:

- scope and description,
- bounty amount or points,
- project guidelines,
- any application process (if applicable).

---

### Step 5 – Start Working on an Issue

Workflow is GitHub‑native:

1. On GitHub, **comment** or follow instructions to express interest (some projects may ask you to “claim” an issue).
2. **Fork or clone** the repository.
3. Create a branch and start coding.
4. Open a **pull request (PR)** that:
   - references the funded issue (e.g., “Fixes #123”),
   - meets the project’s contribution guidelines.

Grainlify will detect:

- the PR,
- its link to the funded issue,
- its status (open, merged, closed).

---

### Step 6 – Get Reviewed and Merged

Maintainers will:

- review your PR,
- request changes if needed,
- merge it when it meets the requirements.

Once your PR is **merged**:

- Grainlify’s backend updates the issue and contribution status.
- If the issue is funded and all conditions are satisfied, your contribution becomes **eligible for payout**.

Conditions typically include:

- merged PR linked to funded issue,
- you are **KYC‑verified**,
- there is sufficient escrow balance,
- any program‑specific rules are met (e.g., deadline, multiple winners).

---

### Step 7 – Receive Payout

Once your contribution is eligible:

1. Grainlify computes payout amounts off‑chain based on points, rules, and issue configuration.
2. Grainlify triggers a **payout transaction** on the relevant escrow contract.
3. The escrow contract sends funds **directly to your wallet** on‑chain.

You can then:

- see the payout in:
  - your Grainlify **profile** or **payout history**,
  - your wallet and blockchain explorer.

No manual steps, emails, or invoices are required to receive funds.

---

## Tracking Your History

Your contributor profile typically includes:

- A **contribution calendar** (GitHub‑style heatmap).
- A list of:
  - issues you worked on,
  - PRs you submitted,
  - payouts you received.
- Aggregate statistics:
  - number of contributions,
  - total rewards earned,
  - breakdown by project, ecosystem, or language.

This can help you:

- showcase your OSS impact,
- understand which projects value your work most,
- decide where to focus next.

## Tips for Successful Contributions

- **Read issue descriptions carefully**:
  - understand scope,
  - confirm acceptance criteria,
  - check any deadlines.
- **Communicate with maintainers**:
  - comment before starting,
  - clarify doubts early,
  - avoid duplicate work on the same issue.
- **Follow project guidelines**:
  - coding style,
  - testing requirements,
  - commit message conventions.
- **Be responsive during review**:
  - address feedback constructively,
  - keep your PR focused and clean.

The goal is a smooth flow from **work → merge → payout** with minimal friction.
