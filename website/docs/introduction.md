# Introduction

Welcome to **Grainlify**, the grant execution layer for open-source ecosystems.

Grainlify connects open-source projects with ecosystem funding and **automates payouts** for real GitHub contributions. Ecosystems lock funds into on-chain escrows, maintainers turn issues into funded bounties, and contributors get **fair, non-custodial rewards** when their work is merged.

Whether you're a maintainer looking to grow your repo, an ecosystem team running programs, or a contributor searching for real-world impact, **Grainlify** is the place to start, contribute, and thrive.
