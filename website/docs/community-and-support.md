# Community & Support

This page explains how users of Grainlify can get help, give feedback, and stay connected with the team and wider community.

> Replace the example channels below with the real links and contact details for your deployment.

---

## Getting Help

For **day‑to‑day questions** (how to use the app, issues with bounties, etc.), we recommend:

- **In‑app help**
  - Use any built‑in help widget or “Help” links to access FAQ and guides.
- **Community chat**
  - Join the project’s primary chat (e.g., Discord, Telegram, Slack).
  - Suggested structure:
    - `#announcements` – official updates.
    - `#ecosystems` – questions from ecosystem teams.
    - `#maintainers` – project owners and maintainers.
    - `#contributors` – contributor questions and support.

Fill in the actual URLs and channel names based on where your community lives.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter bugs or missing features:

- **Create a GitHub issue**
  - Use the Grainlify GitHub repository issue tracker.
  - Include:
    - what you were trying to do,
    - what you expected to happen,
    - what actually happened (with screenshots if useful).

- **Security issues**
  - For sensitive security findings, use a private channel:
    - a dedicated security email (e.g., `security@yourdomain`),
    - or a responsible disclosure program.

> Do not post detailed security vulnerabilities in public channels before responsible disclosure.

## Feedback and Feature Requests

We encourage feedback from:

- **Ecosystem teams** – how to better support your grant programs.
- **Maintainers** – what would make running bounties easier.
- **Contributors** – what would make contributing smoother and more rewarding.

You can:

- open **feature request issues** on GitHub, or
- share ideas in community channels for discussion.

## Status and Incidents

For production deployments, we recommend:

- maintaining a **status page** (e.g., `status.yourdomain.com`) where users can see:
  - current system status,
  - ongoing incidents,
  - historical uptime.
- communicating major incidents via:
  - announcements channel in the community chat,
  - short post‑mortems once issues are resolved.

Add links to these resources here once they are set up.
