# Profile Page

Each contributor in Grainlify has a **profile page** that showcases their open‑source work and rewards across programs and projects.

---

## What You See on a Profile

While exact layout may evolve, a typical profile includes:

- **Identity**
  - GitHub username and avatar.
  - Display name and short bio (where supported).
  - Linked social accounts or websites (optional).

- **Contribution History**
  - List of funded issues and PRs the contributor has worked on.
  - Status for each (open, merged, paid).

- **Contribution Calendar**
  - A GitHub‑style heatmap of recent activity.
  - Quick visual view of when the contributor has been active.

- **Stats & Highlights**
  - Total rewards earned (by asset or USD equivalent, where available).
  - Number of projects and ecosystems contributed to.
  - Top languages or domains (if tracked).

---

## Payout History

The profile is also where contributors can review their **payouts**:

- Each payout typically shows:
  - date and time,
  - amount and asset (e.g., XLM, USDC),
  - source program or bounty,
  - transaction/hash link on the underlying chain.

This provides a **transparent record** of how open‑source work has translated into on‑chain rewards.

## Editing Your Profile

Depending on the deployment, contributors may be able to:

- edit their display name and bio,
- link or update social profiles,
- manage connected wallets (in a dedicated Wallets or Payouts section),
- manage KYC status entry points (often via a **Verify identity** button).

The intent is for your Grainlify profile to become a concise, verifiable snapshot of your impact across programs and ecosystems.
